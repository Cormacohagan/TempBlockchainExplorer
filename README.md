Go-Ethereum Private Blockchain network
Web3.py Ethereum API

Node.js/JS/Express/HTML/CSS

Several External APIs
Geth (Go Ethereum) Private Blockchain

##Run Programs:

Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to add a proper service management wrapper like Docker.

As such, to run the websites just run "./runSites" in this directory.

Alternatively, the server file in each website is located in /bin at the base of the directory.

You can use node bin/www to run them individually.

The ports for each site are as follows:
-localhost:3001/ - Blockchain Explorer
-localhost:3002/ - Business Portal
-localhost:3003/ - Client Application
